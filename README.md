# Wireless IoT Reminder Firmware

This repository contains the firmware for a wireless Internet of Things (IoT) reminder system. The system is designed to send reminders wirelessly to multiple devices.

## Features

- **Wireless Communication**: The system uses NRF24L01 modules for wireless communication between devices.
- **Multiple Devices**: The system supports communication with multiple devices simultaneously.
- **Custom Reminders**: Users can set custom reminders on the devices.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

- Arduino IDE
- ESP32 board
- NRF24L01 module

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Arduino IDE.
3. Connect your ESP32 board to your computer.
4. Select the correct board and port in the Arduino IDE.
5. Upload the code to your ESP32 board.

## Usage

Once the firmware is uploaded to the ESP32 board, the system is ready to use. You can set reminders through the serial monitor in the Arduino IDE.
